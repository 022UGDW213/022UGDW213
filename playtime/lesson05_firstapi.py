# Exercise: Using your first API

# API documentation: http://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/doc

# Goal 1:
#   Ask the user for the movie title they want to check
#   Display all of the details about the movie returned by the API
#
#   Things to keep in mind:
#       How will your program behave when multiple movies are returned?
#       How will your program behave when no movies are returned?
#       How will your program behave with works like "the" in the title?

# Goal 2:
#   Check to see if the user input is a movie title or an ImdbID and use the proper endpoint

# Goal 3:
# Integrate this with the Open Movie Database API: http://www.omdbapi.com/
#   Display all of the details from both APIs when searching for a movie.
#   Note that you may need to prefix your ImdbIDs with 'tt' to get the search to work.
