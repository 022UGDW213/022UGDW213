In here are code snippets, examples, and other ways to help teach some of the difficult concepts and tricks in Python.

Suggested Learning Progression

If you're new to Python you may wonder what you should learn and when you should learn it.  I recommend this order:

General Programming Basics
- Simple Math
- Variable Assignment
- Basic Syntax and Logic
- Data Types: int, float, bool, str

Strings
- Identifying and using strings
- String slicing
- String formatting
- String methods
- - str.replace()
- - str.find()
- - str.count()
- - str.lower()

Conditionals
- Logical control; changing the behavior of your programs
- and keyword, or keyword
- if / else structure
- if / elif ... / else structure
- Nesting conditionals

Lists
- Containers for data types
- First In, Last Out (Stack)
- List methods
- - list.append()
- - list.insert()
- - list.pop()
- - list.extend()
- Finding items in list (in keyword)

Loops
- for loop (for each item in a list: ...)
- enumerate()
- zip()
- range()
- while loop (ask each time: is this still true?)

Strings to Lists and Vice-Versa
- str.join() (create a string from a list)
- str.split() (create a list from a string)

File handling
- with open(filename) as textfile: ...
- file.read()
- Reading text files 
- Reading CSV files
- File handling flags (r, w, b, +)
- Writing to files
