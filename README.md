In here are code snippets, examples, and other ways to help teach some of the difficult concepts and tricks in Python.

- Data Types: int, float, bool, str

Strings
- Identifying and using strings
- String slicing
- String formatting
- String methods
- - str.replace()
- - str.find()
- - str.count()
- - str.lower()

Conditionals
- Logical control; changing the behavior of your programs
- and keyword, or keyword

- if / elif ... / else structure
- Nesting conditionals

Lists
- Containers for data types
- First In, Last Out (Stack)
- List methods
- - list.append()
- - list.insert()
