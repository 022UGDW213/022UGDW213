In here are code snippets, examples, and other ways to help teach some of the difficult concepts and tricks in Python.

Suggested Learning Progression

If you're new to Python you may wonder what you should learn and when you should learn it.  I recommend this order:

General Programming Basics
- Simple Math
- Variable Assignment
- Basic Syntax and Logic
- Data Types: int, float, bool, str

Strings
- Identifying and using strings
- String slicing
- String formatting
- String methods
- - str.replace()
- - str.find()
- - str.count()
- - str.lower()

Conditionals
- Logical control; changing the behavior of your programs
- and keyword, or keyword
- if / else structure
- if / elif ... / else structure
- Nesting conditionals

Lists
- Containers for data types
- First In, Last Out (Stack)
- List methods
- - list.append()
- - list.insert()
- - list.pop()
- - list.extend()
- Finding items in list (in keyword)

Loops
- for loop (for each item in a list: ...)
- enumerate()
- zip()
- range()
- while loop (ask each time: is this still true?)

Strings to Lists and Vice-Versa
- str.join() (create a string from a list)
- str.split() (create a list from a string)

File handling
- with open(filename) as textfile: ...
- file.read()
- Reading text files 
- Reading CSV files
- File handling flags (r, w, b, +)
- Writing to files

Functions
- def keyword
- arguments
- default arguments
- *args
- **kwargs
- return keyword
- sequence unpacking (return and receive multiple values)
- namespaces

Dictionaries


Standard Library
- import keyword
- from ... import ... as ... structure
- time
- random
- math
- re (regular expressions)
- os
- sys

External Libraries (Not necessarily in order; keep these in mind)
- Installing external libraries with easy_install
- Using easy_install to install pip (an easier / better way to install external libraries)
- requests (web crawling made easy)
- BeautifulSoup (parsing HTML)
- xlrd (Read Excel .xls files)
- xlwt (Write to Excel .xls files)
- xlsxwriter (Write to Excel .xls and .xlsx files, with additional functionality beyond xlwt)
- cherrypy (Simple, lightweight framework for serving web pages)
- psycopg2 (Connect to and issue SQL commands to your postgresql database)
